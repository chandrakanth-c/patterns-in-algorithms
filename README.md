# Patterns In Algorithms 
Discussions around Patterns in Algorithms.

## Objective
The intention of making this github repo `public` is just to provide a compressed version of discussions around  `Patterns In Algorithms` 
based on the current viable source of thruths (geeksforgeeks.com, stackoverflow.com etc) on the internet and based on conversations with 
LLMs (chatgpt,gemini,claude etc) which is some percent true. Hence, this repo would provide use with popular patterns in algorithms with 
the reliability percentage that varies somewhere between LLMs (lower bound) and popular articles on the internet.
