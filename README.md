# Patterns In Algorithms
Discussions around Patterns in Algorithms.

## Objective
The intention of making this github repo `public` is just to provide a compressed version of `thruth/source of thruth`
of discussions around  `Patterns In Algorithms` based on the current viable source of thruths (specifically not 
through LLMs) on the internet.

I do not claim any rights to the answers themselves. All sources will be listed in every file with due diligence.

## Subsections

[TBD]
